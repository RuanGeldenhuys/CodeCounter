# Code Counter
This is a simple Python script that scans a given folder and counts the amount of lines of code for a specific file extension. It is intended to be used on project where code is written accross multiple scripts, which makes counting the amount of lines difficult. Does this solve a real problem? No. But it is something I am often curious about, so that is why I made it.

## Required packages
- os
- tkinter
  + filedialog
  + messagebox
